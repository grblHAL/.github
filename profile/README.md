## The ultimate [Grbl](https://github.com/gnea/grbl) port:

* available for many [32 bit processors](https://github.com/grblHAL/drivers) and [controllers](https://github.com/grblHAL/Controllers).
* hardware abstracted \(HAL\) architecture with processor specific drivers and [shared core](https://github.com/grblHAL/core).
* [open](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/hal_8h.html) architecture supports [3rd party drivers](https://github.com/dresco/STM32H7xx) and [plugins](https://github.com/grblHAL/plugins), including [user defined](https://github.com/grblHAL/Templates) plugins.
* [extended GCode support](https://github.com/grblHAL/core#supported-g-codes): [tool changes](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Manual,-semi-automatic-and-automatic-tool-change), canned cycles, extra inputs and outputs, optional [parameter and expression](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Expressions-and-flow-control) handling, ... 
* [networking](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_networking/) \(WiFi or ethernet\) and [SD card](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_SD_card/) options available for some controllers. [WebUI](https://github.com/grblHAL/Plugin_WebUI) options. 
* [Web Builder](http://svn.io-engineering.com:8080) available for the most popular processors, no need to install a toolchain for creating the firmware.
* works with all mainstream GCode senders, some may require [compatibility level](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Compatibility-level) set to function properly.
